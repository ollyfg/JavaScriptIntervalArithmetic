JavaScriptIntervalArithmetic
============================

JavaScript Implementation of Interval Arithmetic.

This is a javascript library for Interval Arithmetic. Interval Arithmetic lets you estimate how much the errors on numbers change when you do maths with them. It can also be useful to prevent rounding errors in floating point arithmetic.
You can find out more about Interval Arithmetic and its uses [on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic).

This library is being used for implicit function plotting by [Function Grapher](http://zizhujy.com/FunctionGrapher).
It is also used in the advanced mode of [my Uncertainty Calculator](http://ollyfg.com/uncertainty.html)
